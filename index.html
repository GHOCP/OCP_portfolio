          I worked as a UX design intern in the MRO Lab of Air France & KLM E&M, partaking in several projects created by our team. Here two projects are introduced: redesign of the official website of Air France & KLM E&M, and the onboarding platform for interns.

          “Viva”: This is the project competing for the design challenge hosted by the Ilionx Inc. company, which concentrated on raising the client’s awareness of vitality. I proposed a pixel-art style digital-pet-based application as a team leader. I also collaborated with the system developers to establish the system’s information architecture and sketched the user interfaces across different types of digital devices for the product users and a back-end platform for the management of all users’ vitality states.

          “Hobb”: This is an AI-driven group project aiming at recommending activities for university students who seek a richer social life, mainly based on their personalities analyzed by using artificial intelligence techniques. The finalized trained AI model and our aim were reflected by a mobile App. I mainly took roles in product brainstorming and user interface design.

          “Re-Memory”: This is a group project for the design challenge from the “User Experience Design” course, collaborating with a local nursing house for seniors (KBO). We delved into creating “Warm Technology”, which pivots around making the lives of people suffering from dementia better. Initiated from the problem statement based on previous research, a prototype of the proposed game was created (2022 Fall).
