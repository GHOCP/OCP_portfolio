            <div id="separator"></div>
            <p id="explanation">This is an AI-driven group project aiming at recommending activities for university students who seek a richer social life, mainly based on their personalities analyzed by using artificial intelligence techniques. The finalized trained AI model and our aim were reflected by a mobile App. I mainly took roles in product brainstorming and user interface design.</p>

                        <p class="mode-intro">The hinge structure of the board enables a physical connection with another board, This allows two players to play against each other by flipping card sets on their respective board, which is a bit more challenging but adds to the gamification. Besides, by enlarging the number of cards, this mode underlines our notion of “sharing the memories”.</p>

                        <p class="mode-intro">Using one board, this mode allows the PwD to play the game with caregivers/family members, who will lead the PwD to press the button to look at the hidden cards and touch the fabric on the wheel that corresponds to the content of the exposed card. Once a match is found, the retro TV display which is connected to the board through Bluetooth will play the corresponding video clip.</p>

                        <p class="mode-intro">This mode simulates a normal activity: “card inserting”, which is common in various daily situations such as retrieving money in the ATM, entering/exiting a parking lot, and so on. Easily understandable, the “insert and play the video” gaming circle serves as a process of “simply enjoying wonderful moments in life” and/or “weaving pieces of memories together”.</p>
